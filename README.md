<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

## 📚 Introduction

<b>[Pomomilk](http://pomomilk.com/)</b> is a responsive, single-page interactive pomodoro timer. Users can easily control and configure the auto-cycling timer. The large, customizable display is filled with milk to visualize focus time progression, then similarly drained during breaks.

> The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a time management method that involves breaking down work into intervals called "pomodoros" (typically 25 min). These are separated by short breaks (3-5 min), with every fourth being a longer break (15-30min).
